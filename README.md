## Key Findings

- **Production:**  
  Global coffee production increased by 27.4% from 2011 to 2022, reaching 171.3 million 60kg bags. Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia account for over 50% of world output, creating supply vulnerability.

- **Consumption:**  
  Consumption grew steadily (2.3% CAGR), with the highest per capita rates in Nordic countries. Emerging markets, especially in Asia Pacific, show strong growth potential.

- **Price Volatility:**  
  Coffee prices were highly volatile, with major peaks in 2011 and 2017. There is a strong negative correlation between price and production volumes.

- **Sustainability:**  
  Certified sustainable coffee production rose from 15% to 36% of global output. Climate change poses a significant risk, with up to 22% yield reduction projected by 2030 in traditional regions without adaptation.

- **Market Value:**  
  The market is projected to grow from $138.37B in 2025 to $174.25B by 2030 (4.72% CAGR), with premium segments capturing a larger share.
